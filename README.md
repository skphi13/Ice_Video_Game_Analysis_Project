# Ice_Video_Game_Analysis_Project
Identify patterns that determine whether or not a video game will succeed or not. Dataset from video game store Ice.

# Intorduction

In this study I will look at a dataset from 2016 to prepare a 2017 prognosis for a company named Ice. We will determine whether or not a video game will succeed or not based on statistical and exploratory data analysis. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and help with planning advertising campaigns for Ice.

# Hypotheses

1. Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.

2. Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are the same.

# Conclusions

**Platform Lifecycles and Market Trends:**

The lifespan and market presence of gaming platforms have evolved significantly. Older platforms like the WonderSwan, Game Boy, and Nintendo 64 became obsolete as newer technologies and consumer preferences shifted. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox experienced a gradual phase-out as newer generations of consoles took precedence, highlighting a transition period in the market. Handheld devices such as the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance demonstrated a longer market relevance, reflecting sustained consumer interest before their decline.

**Sales Performance Across Platforms:**

The box plot analysis of global sales shows that platforms like the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 achieved higher median sales, indicating strong and consistent performance. Conversely, platforms such as the PSP and PlayStation Vita had lower sales figures, suggesting less market success. Variability in sales across platforms is significant, though a more detailed statistical analysis would be needed to confirm the extent of these differences.

**Impact of Reviews on Sales:**

For the PlayStation 4, critic scores show a moderate positive correlation with sales, indicating that higher critic ratings tend to boost sales. However, user scores exhibit almost no correlation with sales, suggesting that user reviews are less influential on commercial success compared to professional reviews. Other factors such as marketing and brand recognition likely play a more substantial role in determining sales performance.

**Regional Market Preferences:**

Regional differences are evident in platform and genre preferences. North America shows strong support for Xbox and Wii, Europe favors PlayStation platforms, and Japan exhibits a preference for handheld and domestic consoles like the DS. Genre preferences also vary, with Action and Sports genres dominating Western markets, while Japan shows a stronger inclination towards Role-Playing games. These variations reflect regional cultural influences and market strategies.

**Statistical Analysis Results:**

Statistical tests confirm that there is no significant difference in user scores between Action and Sports games. However, there is a statistically significant difference between user scores for Xbox One and PC games, with Xbox One games generally receiving lower user scores compared to PC games.

**Promising Platforms:**

PlayStation 4 (PS4): Continues to dominate in both North American and European markets with strong sales and consistent performance.

Xbox One (XOne): Although it trails behind the PS4, it maintains a strong presence in North America and shows potential for continued market relevance.

Nintendo 3DS (3DS): Particularly promising in Japan, the 3DS highlights the continued demand for handheld gaming devices in certain regions.

**Final Conclusion:**

The gaming industry is characterized by diverse trends in platform life cycles, sales performance, and regional preferences. While critic reviews positively impact sales, user scores do not significantly influence commercial success. Understanding regional preferences and the multifaceted nature of factors driving sales is crucial for industry success. The promising platforms identified offer insights into future market opportunities, with a focus on platforms that maintain strong regional sales and appeal to consumer preferences.
